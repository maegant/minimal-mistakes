## Custom TKL Mechanical Keyboard
Over the pandemic, I spent my additional free time towards developing a custom TKL mechanical keyboard from scratch. 

### PCB Design
I wasn't able to find a reasonable TKL PCB with programmable RGB LEDs for each key, so I designed my own. I starting with the open-source layout [XMMX](https://easyeda.com/farmakon/XMMX-0447d28c1e4644b88fd04905d983684d), and modified it to include RGB LEDS (WS2812B) for each key. You can find the PCB layout on EasyEDA as [LED XMMX](https://oshwlab.com/mtucker/led-xmmx)

<!-- ### Case Design
I also wasn't able to find an affordable PCB case, so I also designed my own that I laser cut out of acrylic. 

### Switches

### Keycaps
